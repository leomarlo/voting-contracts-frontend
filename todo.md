## TODOs

#### VoteOnInstance

Even after the deadline, submitting a vote (which I wonder why it is possible because implementing permitted should trigger positivley) doesnt enable immediately the "implement" button. This should happen dynamically.

There should be an immediate update of the result when the vote came in

Token balance is not anymore relevant once the vote has finished

Every details page should by default have a close / hide this page button

When i disconnect and have the details page open it should actually close

#### Menu

There should be four colours. Active-hover, Inactive-hover, active-nohover, inactive-nohover (DONE)
